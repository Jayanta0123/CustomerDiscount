# CustomerDiscount
This app takes two parameters (spend and customer-type) as input and calculates discount based on the customer-type and the slabs.

# How to use
There are two types of customers - regular and premium, and their discount slabs are also different. Based on the slab-details for these two types of customers, and the input-spend data, the system computes how much discount the customer is eligible to receive.

# Project details
You need Java 1.8 and Maven to run the project
